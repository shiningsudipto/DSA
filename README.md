### Syntax

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    cout << "Apna College";
}
```

- **iostream**
  - It is part of the C++ Standard Library. It provides functionality for input and output operations, such as:
  - std::cin for reading input.
  - std::cout for writing output.
  - std::cerr for error messages.
- **namespace std**

  - It avoids the need to explicitly qualify standard library objects like std::cout and std::cin.
  - Without it, you'd need to use the std:: prefix every time you reference an item from the std namespace.

- cout is like print/console
- cpp case sensitive
- **';'** means ending like JS
